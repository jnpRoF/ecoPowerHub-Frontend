I am building a dApp on toronet called ecoPowerHub. The Platform has 2 parts.
It is an energy market place where companies come and show thier service and userrs check thorugh and order and pay for their service. 
Also, There's a part where people csan invest in a company. So to invest in a company . A company will give us thew shares they want to put out and then they people invest in it . in percantage . Any user that invests in  a  particular company get's the same peorcentage off the any service tgta the company sells.

All the investors address are kept in the backend and when ever an comapony sells a service they(the investors) are all credited.

toro is toroNet stable coin. 1 toroNet = $1;

If Company A is worth 5 million toro
and they put out 2 million toro for investment.

If  a User H buys 10% of 2 million toro which is 200,000 toro.

onnce Compny A sells service to people worth any amount while crediting Campany A . User H recieves 10% of that amount.
